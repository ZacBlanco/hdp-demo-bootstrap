# Config

`config.py` is a module which contains some methods to make reading configuration files easy.

--------

## Methods

### `Ambari.read_config(config_file)`

This method retrieves and reads a configuration file `conf` directory and returns an embedded dictionary object where all of the key-value pairs are stored

[See more on the configuration file format in the python docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html)

A typical configuration file has the following format:

	[SECTION HEADER 1]
	key1=value1
	key2=value2
	
	[SECTION HEADER 2]
	key3=value3
	key4=value4
	
	....
	
Using the `read_config` method you can use the object to access the values via the section header and then the key name

Example:

	conf = config.read_config(filename)
	
	conf['SECTION HEADER 1']['key1'] # Now holds value1
	conf['SECTION HEADER 2']['key4'] # Now holds value4
	
### `config.get_conf_dir()`

This method will search for a directory named `conf` in the local directory structure. It will return the path to this directory. 

The method is used when searching for a configuration file in the `read_config` method. However, it may be used outside of the `config` module if other modules utilize the `conf` directory.

**IMPORTANT** This method **will** fail if the python program is executed outside of the local directory structure of this bootstrap project. The program must be executed within the directory structure of the project in order to find the configuration directory

### `Ambari.get_config()`

This method retrieves and reads a all **XML files** stored in the `configurations` directory and returns an embedded dictionary object where all of the key-value pairs are stored in the form below:

	conf = config.get_config()
	conf['configurations']['FILENAME']['PROPERTY_NAME'] = PROPERTY_VALUE


i.e. if we had the file `service-config.xml` then we would access it's properties via:

	conf['configurations']['service-config']


### `Ambari.read_xml_config(config_file)`

This method retrieves and reads a configuration file `configurations` directory and returns a  dictionary object where all of the key-value pairs are stored
	
	conf = config.read_xml_config(FILE_PATH)
	conf['PROPERTY_NAME'] = PROPERTY_VALUE

The file format of the XML should follow the following scheme:

	<configuration>
		<property>
			<name>prop1</name>
			<values>val1</value>
			<description></description>
		</property>
		
		<property>
			<name>prop2</name>
			<values>val2</value>
			<description></description>
		</property>
		
More information on this format can be found in the [quickstart guide](README.md#configuration-files)
