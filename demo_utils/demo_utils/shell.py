# The shell class defines just a few functions which can make executing commands easier
# run
# 	This command has two possible ways to be called
# 	(command) which is just a single line with all arguments
# 	(command, args) which simply just joins a string with the command and arguments
# 
# It is also possible to change the current working directory (cwd)
# for commands which are sensitive to file locations
# (Unfortunately 'cd' doesn't work)

# If no arguments are passed for args, then it is assumed to be a string of length 0
# If no arguments are passed to the constructor we assume default cwd
